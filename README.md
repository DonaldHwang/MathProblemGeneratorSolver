# MathProblemGeneratorSolver
Task 1.  A Math problem Generator.  It should generate primary school level Math problems(questions) according to the requirement specified in a input text file, and output the problems generated in a text file.  The problems should cover + - * / operations in integers, fractions and fix-point numbers with given ranges. (Tips: You may design a special ID to identify problem type & problem itself for every problem.) 
 
Task 2.  A Math problem Solver.  It read the problems generated by Task 1 and output a reference answer text file that contains problems & answers. 
 
Task 3 (Optional).  A Math Answer Checker.  It read an exam paper text file including problems with answers given by students, check all answers one by one, add a CORRECT or WRONG mark for every problem, and output a text file based on the input paper with checking marks (CORRECT or WRONG).
